	Have you ever thought about the inevitable possibilities of substance use and abuse in the youth? D.A.R.E is a remarkable way to show and enlighten adolescents about the risks of nicotine, tobacco, cannabis also known as marijuana, and many more dangerous substances. I am very grateful that I have the privilege to learn from this wondrous program, as some cannot. The acronym, D.A.R.E represents Drugs, Abuse, Resistance, and Education. Those 4 simple words can make an enormous difference as it helps to alert children of the potential dangers and issues they may encounter.

	A vape is a very commonly used device that is especially used among teenagers. It contains a heavily addictive chemical called nicotine. Nicotine is also utilized in cigarettes and many other excessively addictive substances. Although vaping may seem like a much healthier and ameliorate thing than smoking, it's still not recommended for anyone since it's still extremely hazardous. Aside from the exception of getting peer-pressured to vape. Peer pressure is a force or people who are trying to influence you by making you do something harmful. One of the biggest case scenarios in this is if someone is making you do something illegal.
	
	The initialism, D.A.R.E may also represent Define, Assess, Respond and Evaluate which is a decision-making model for adolescents who are undergoing difficult situations. Throughout the past 17 weeks, my class has been thoroughly taught by (Mr police officer). We grasped how to evaluate and assess the situation effectively, it helps by defining the situation and finding what's best for you. 

	One of the most significant things I’ve retained in D.A.R.E is verbal communication and nonverbal communication along with body language. Verbal communication is when you express yourself with words. Nonverbal communication is when you use your body language to express your feelings. You can dexterously read someone’s body language from time to time, such as observing their facial expressions and posture. 

	D.A.R.E isn’t just all about drugs. It teaches about the importance of communication and how to handle different situations. I will undoubtedly make great use of the things I’ve mustered in D.A.R.E to acquire more adequate communication skills and find the right choices.
